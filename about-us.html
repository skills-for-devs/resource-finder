      <h2>Lauren Sierra</h2>
      <img src="images/lauren.jpg">
      <p> I have a backround as a phlebotomy technician and previously as a server and bartender. I first looked at code
        back in Semptember, jumped into a coding bootcamp two months later and moved to Seattle a few weeks after that.
        Whew!
        I am passionate about art, everything from dance to painting, and being a part of positive change in the world.
        I enjoy learning and I write clean user friendly code. My goal is to be a part of a team that is passionate
        about their work and live adventerous lives.</p>
